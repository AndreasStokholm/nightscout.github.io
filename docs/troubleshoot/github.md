# GitHub Troubleshooting

### I lost access to my GitHub

Create a new account and fork cgm-remote monitor as described [here](../../nightscout/github).

**Follow only Step 1.**

You can now upgrade or redeploy your Nightscout using redeploy as explained [here](../../update/redeploy/#step-1-cleanup-github).  You won't have to delete the existing repository since it's not there for the moment. Go down to Fork cgm-remote-monitor in the explanation.

If you're using Heroku you'll need to [reconnect](../heroku/#cannot-find-cgm-remote-monitor-in-heroku-no-github-source-visible) your app to GitHub.

If you're using Railway you'll need to [reconnect](../railway/#reconnect-github-to-your-project) your app to GitHub.
