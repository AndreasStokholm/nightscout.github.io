## Building Nightscout DIY in a cloud platform

You can run your Nightscout site in several vendors platforms, using free or paid accounts.  

Below is a list of useable platforms. There are probably others, don't hesitate to [open an issue in the documentation](https://github.com/nightscout/nightscout.github.io/issues) with the easiest deployment method if you want to see them named here.

## Building Nightscout DIY in a virtual server

You can run your Nightscout site in physical or virtual private servers, using free or paid accounts.  
The [original](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/project-glu/blob/master/README.md) Nightscout project was also developed to run in Digital Ocean.

You can use step by step Linux commands or deploy with a **simple** scripted install.

Below is a list of some VPS. There are probably others, don't hesitate to [open an issue in the documentation](https://github.com/nightscout/nightscout.github.io/issues) with the easiest deployment method if you want to see them named here.

First select your VPS:

[Google Cloud](../../vendors/google/new_user) with a [Scripted deployment](../xdripteam) (one command).  
[Oracle](../../vendors/oracle/new_user)  and extensive documentation (npm and Docker).  
[Digital Ocean](../../vendors/digitalocean/new_user) (example). There are many others that can be used either command by command or using the [Scripted deployment](../xdripteam).  
[Amazon Web Service](https://github.com/rajdeut/terraform-aws-nightscout#readme)

Some common deployment methods:

[Ubuntu](../ubuntu) commands.  
[Docker](../nightscout/docker) container.

## Building Nightscout inside your NAS

Don't buy a NAS device just for this, but if you already have one that's worth a try!

You can host your Nightscout site in your [Synology](../../vendors/synology/new_user) NAS.  
You can also try with your [QNAP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpF6Y3kPQqc9KOsClIQt686HDLhGfFxwz4vGfq8E254/edit) NAS.

</br>

## Building Nightscout with a Raspberry PI 4

If you own one, you can use it to host your Nightscout, see [here](../../vendors/raspberry-pi/new_user).
