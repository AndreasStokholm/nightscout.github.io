# Redeploy with GitHub

When encountering update issues with GitHub, the easiest method it to delete it and fork the project again.

AAPS users: mind the [compatibility matrix](../nightscout/close_loop.md#aaps)!

## Delete your own fork of cgm-remote-monitor

```{include} /vendors/github/delete.md

```

## Fork the Nightscout project

```{include} /vendors/github/fork.md

```
