!!!warning  
    Since April 13th 2022 Heroku [Incident](https://status.heroku.com/incidents/2413), upgrading and redeploying from GitHub is not possible anymore  
    Whilst this is probably a temporary situation, you need to deploy a new site from scratch to bypass this limitation.  

</br>

## Temporary workaround for Nightscout update and redeploy.

</br>

!!!note "Requirements"  
    This is a workaround if you already have a deployed Nightscout and a functional MongoDB Atlas database.  
    For a brand new Nightscout site follow [these instructions](../../nightscout/new_user).

</br>

### Step 1 - Put your current Nightscout site in maintenance mode

Log into your [Heroku account](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and select your app.

<img src="../../nightscout/img/SetupNS00.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

Scroll down and enable Maintenance Mode.  
Your current Nightscout site will stop but you won't lose any data.

### Step 2 - Rename your current Nightscout app

Change your Nightscout site name, for example add `-disabled` at the end of the current name.

### Step 3 - Display your Heroku variables

Display your original site Heroku variables.

- Click `Settings`

<img src="../../nightscout/img/SetupNS01.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

- Scroll down and click `Reveal Config Vars`

<img src="../../nightscout/img/SetupNS02.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

### Step 4 - Update GitHub

Make sure you open GitHub in a new browser tab, keep the variables view opened.

Follow the [update instructions](../update/#step1-update-your-repository-in-github), but **only Step 1**. Then come back here.

If you failed to update, follow the [redeploy instructions](../redeploy/#step-1-cleanup-github), but **only Step 1**. Then come back here.

### Step 5 - Deploy a new Nightscout site

Follow the instructions after [the `(ignore this line)` bookmark](../../nightscout/new_user/#ignore-this-line).

**For each line requiring you to enter data, make sure you use the previous site values:**

- App name
- API_SECRET
- MONGODB_URI or MONGO_CONNECT
- etc...

Once deploy will complete, your new Nightscout site will replace in a transparent way the current one, you won't need to change anything in your follower apps, uploader, etc. But for this you need to copy all variables values and keep them identical to the original site.
