<span style="font-size:smaller;">**APPLIES TO:**</span> <img src="../../../vendors/img/DO.png" style="zoom:60%;" />

The original documentation is here [https://gist.github.com/DrCR77/eb08b830d4f31092cf65a8a9976dc0a6](https://gist.github.com/DrCR77/eb08b830d4f31092cf65a8a9976dc0a6).

!!!info "Cost"  
Nightscout and its database will fit in a Basic droplet at 6$ / month.  
You can test this solution for free for 2 months.  

Consider [Nightscout as a service](/#nightscout-as-a-service) as an option.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub account

</br>

If you already have a GitHub account, [update](../../../nightscout/github/#update-your-nightscout-fork) your Nightscout project.

If you don't have a GitHub account [create one](../../../nightscout/github/#create-a-github-account) then [fork the Nightscout project](../../../nightscout/github/#fork-the-nightscout-project) and come back.

</br>

### Step 2 - Create a Droplet

a) Sign up at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and `Sign up with GitHub`.

<img src="../img/DO01.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

b) Authorize DigitalOcean to access GitHub information.

<img src="../img/DO02.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

c) Select `Deploy a virtual machine`.

<img src="../img/DO03.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

d) Select `Ubuntu 20.04 (TLS) x64` using the drop down menu.

<img src="../img/DO04.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

e) Select `SHARED CPU` `Basic` in `Choose a plan`.

<img src="../img/DO05.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

f) Change your Droplet plan to a `$4 Droplet`.  
You can modify this later but you can't select anything cheaper than this first choice.

<img src="../img/DO06.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

g) Choose a datacenter close to where you live.

<img src="../img/DO24.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

h) It is strongly recommended that you select `SSH Key` to have a secure login.  
If you're not technical enough you will probably want to use a standard `root` password. If you decide to do so, make sure it's highly complex and change it regularly to avoid your site being hacked.

<img src="../img/DO07.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

g) Scroll down and click `Create`.

<img src="../img/DO09.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

Wait until your droplet finishes initialization.

</br>

h) You need to confirm your identity with a credit card or with PayPal.  
If you selected a credit card, 5$ will be booked on it: not withdrawn.

<img src="../img/DO08.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

You now have 100$ to spend for free for the next 60 days.

</br>

</br>

### Step 3 - Install MongoDB

a) Select twice your new droplet to open the view you see below, in `Access`, select  `Launch Droplet Console`.

<img src="../img/DO11.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

A terminal window will open.

<img src="../img/DO12.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

b) Update your Ubuntu system (this is a command you should type every 3 or 6 months to keep it updated).  
Enter the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

<img src="../img/DO13.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

You will see it's completed when the terminal stops scrolling text and you're returned to the prompt. Something like this:

<img src="../img/DO14.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

c) Install MongoDB entering the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install mongodb -y
```

Wait until it completes.

</br>

d) Enter in Mongo shell with the following command:

```bash
mongo --port 27017
```

<img src="../img/DO15.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

You will know you've entered the shell when the prompt is displayed: you will see `>`.

Enter

```
use admin
```

<img src="../img/DO16.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

e) We will create an admin user. Decide on a name and a password.  
Avoid reusing other usernames and passwords.
In the example below the user is `john_dbadmin` and the password `5t1ll5053cr3t!`.  
Do NOT use these examples for your database!

Now enter the user creation instruction. It will be made like this:  
**BUT** you need to **replace** `ADMIN_NAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` with those you decided above!

```bash
db.createUser({user: "ADMIN_NAME", pwd: "ADMIN_PASSWORD", roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }] })
```

Which gives for example:

<img src="../img/DO17.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

f) Exit the shell entering:

```bash
exit
```

Mongo will answer `bye` and you'll be back to Ubuntu's command prompt.

</br>

g) Edit your Mongo configuration typing:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/mongodb.conf
```

Nano text editor will open. Yes, that's the easiest way to edit text files in Linux. Don't complain else I'll make you use [vi](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html).

<img src="../img/DO18.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

h) Using your keyboard arrows (no, your mouse doesn't work here), go down until you're on the line reading  `#auth = true` and remove the  `#`. 
<img src="../img/DO19.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

The line should now read:

<img src="../img/DO20.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

i) Save the modified file:

1. Press `Ctrl-O`    (the letter O not zero)
2. Press `Enter`
3. Press `Ctrl-X`

*Note: if you use a Mac the `Ctrl` key is `âŒ˜`*

You can return to step **g.** above if you want to check it's been modified correctly.

</br>

Good. Now you know how to use Nano.

</br>

j) Restart Mongo with this command:

```bash
sudo service mongodb restart
```

Nothing special will display. You will return to the command prompt immediately.

</br>

You have installed the MongoDB application in your droplet.

</br>

### Step 4 - Create a new database

a) Login into Mongo as an admin typing this command:  
**BUT** you need to **replace** `ADMIN_NAME` with your own database administrator name, the one you decided above in **Step 3.e.**

```bash
mongo -u ADMIN_NAME -p --authenticationDatabase admin
```

You will be asked to enter the password matching your admin user (still that one defined in **Step 3.e**.).

This is the example continued, don't use `john_dbadmin` in your case: use your own.

<img src="../img/DO21.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

b) Now you need to create a database name.  
Make it simple (letters), this is just the place your Nightscout data will be stored.  
Type this command:  
**BUT** you need to **replace** `MONGO_NS_DB` with your own database name.

```bash
use MONGO_NS_DB
```

In the example below the database name is `NS-DB`.

<img src="../img/DO22.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

c) Then you need to create a database user. It's not the same than the Mongo user.  
Invent a name (letters and numbers) and a password (letters and numbers, uppercase and lowercase).

Type this command:  
**BUT** you need to **replace** `MONGO_NS_USER` with your database user name, `MONGO_NS_PASSWORD` with its matching password and `MONGO_NS_DB` with the database name you created above.

```bash
db.createUser({user: "MONGO_NS_USER", pwd: "MONGO_NS_PASSWORD", roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "MONGO_NS_DB" }]})
```

In the example below the database username is `john_nightscout`, the password is `Nightscout19800416` and database still `NS-DB`.

<img src="../img/DO23.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

d) Check you can login into Mongo with this user typing this command:  
**BUT** you need to **replace** `MONGO_NS_USER` with your own database administrator name, and replace `MONGO_NS_DB` with your own database name. The ones you decided above in **Step 3.c.**

```bash
mongo -u MONGO_NS_USER -p --authenticationDatabase MONGO_NS_DB
```

You will be asked to enter the password matching your user (the one defined in **Step 3.c**.).

This is the example continued, don't use `john_nightscout`: use your own.

<img src="../img/DO21.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

e) Exit the shell entering:

```bash
exit
```

Mongo will answer `bye` and you'll be back to Ubuntu's command prompt.

</br>

You have created your Nightscout MongoDB database and its user.

</br>

### Step 5 - Install Nightscout

a) Create a new user.  
You are now running Ubunto with highest privilege. Don't try to run nightscout as root user, it will not work.  
**Replace `mainuser`** with a name of your choice, like your name, only lowercase letters.

```bash
sudo adduser mainuser
```

In the example below, the user name is `john`.

<img src="../img/DO25.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

You need to invent a password for your new user.  
Confirm it then just hit `Enter` for the following lines, when done key `Y` then `Enter`.

<img src="../img/DO26.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

b) Make your user an administrator.  
Type the following command:

**Replace `mainuser`** with your new user name.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo mainuser
```

<img src="../img/DO27.png" style="zoom:80%;" />

</br>

c) Login to the machine using the account we just created.  
Type the following command:

**Replace `mainuser`** with your new user name.

```
ssh mainuser@IP-number
```
