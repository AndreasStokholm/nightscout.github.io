# Fly.IO

![](../img/flyio-logo.png)
[Fly.io](https://fly.io) offers a free 500 hour tier 
of usage, which is not enough for consistent
service for loopers, but can be a great for a
few weeks or for light users of Nightscout.
The $5 tier should be sufficient for loopers
and anyone depending on Nightscout as a
mission critical app.

## Set up new Nightscout

Fly.io is managed through a command line app.
