## [End of Free plan](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter)

Starting October 26, 2022, Heroku will begin deleting inactive accounts and associated storage for accounts that have been inactive for over a year.

Starting November 28, 2022, Heroku plans to stop offering free product plans and plan to start shutting down free dynos and data services.

This means that if you wish to continue using Heroku you need to upgrade your free plan to Hobby ([7$/month](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/usage-and-billing#cost)) **before November 28th 2022**.  
If you already have a Hobby plan you don't need to do anything and you Nightscout site will continue to work as before.
