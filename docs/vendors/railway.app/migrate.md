!!!info "Cost"  
 [Railway.app](https://railway.app/) offers 500 free hours of execution usage per month for the [Starter plan](https://docs.railway.app/reference/plans#starter-plan), that is not enough for loopers, but can be great for a few weeks evaluation or for light users of Nightscout.
The [Developer plan](https://docs.railway.app/reference/plans#developer-plan-offering) should be sufficient for loopers and anyone depending on Nightscout as a mission critical app. Costs will vary depending on your use (We expect the amount to be below or around $5 per month).  
 Consider [Nightscout as a service](/#nightscout-as-a-service) as an option.

## Set up new Nightscout

### Create your Railway, MongoDB Atlas and GitHub accounts from a computer.

Do not change device/computer/browser during the setup process!

!!! note
If you have unexpected issues when creating your site, restart with another browser.

</br>

### Step 1: Create a GitHub account and fork the Nightscout project

</br>

If you don't have a GitHub account [create one](../../../nightscout/github/#create-a-github-account) and come back.  
If you already have a the `cgm-remote-monitor` project in GitHub: [delete it](../../../nightscout/github/#delete-your-own-fork-of-cgm-remote-monitor).

Now [fork the Nightscout cgm-remote-monitor project](../../../nightscout/github/#fork-the-nightscout-project) (just to make sure it will be up to date).

</br>

### Step 2: Create a Railway account

a) Open [railway](https://railway.app) in a new browser tab and click `login`.
