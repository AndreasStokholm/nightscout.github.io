### What Is T1Pal ?

T1Pal provides an always maintained and updated Nightscout site.

- **Privacy**. Unlike DIY, the default T1Pal site is private. Only the account owner can view Nightscout.
- Getting started guide explains getting glucose and insulin data into Nightscout.
- Storage is managed, never worry about MongoDB again.
- Unlimited Shares: Unlike most apps, there is no installation required for sharing Nightscout. Create as many secret sharing links as you like and share them with anyone you want. Revoke or delete access any time.

We make the technology behind Nightscout and manage it for you. There are some important differences between T1Pal and DIY. While most plugins are available, there are a few interacting with third party services that are on our future roadmap. See our [FAQ on differences between T1Pal DIY](https://t1pal.com/legal/faq_8_18_2020_13_38#compare-to-nightscout) for the full details.
